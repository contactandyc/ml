Certainly. In the original Transformer model, the feed-forward network usually expands the hidden dimensions before compressing them back. This expansion can help the model learn more complex representations. Dropout is often added for regularization to prevent overfitting.

Here's how you can modify the feed-forward network part:

```python
self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(embed_size, embed_size * 4),  # Expand dimensions
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.1),  # Dropout for regularization
    nn.Linear(embed_size * 4, embed_size)  # Compress back
)
```

By doing this, you are essentially giving the network more capacity to learn from the data. The dropout layer helps in preventing overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0 during training, which helps to improve generalization.
