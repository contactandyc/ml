Certainly. The training loop is where the actual learning occurs. You iterate through your dataset, feed it through your model, calculate the loss, and update the model's parameters. A typical training loop in PyTorch may look like the following:

### Sample Code:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss
import torch.optim as optim

# Sample data and labels (just for illustration)
data = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1000, 50))  # 1000 samples, sequence length of 50
labels = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (1000, 50))  # corresponding labels

# Data loader
dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(data, labels)
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Initialize model, loss and optimizer
model = GPT3Small(vocab_size, d_model, nhead, num_layers)
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 3
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (x_batch, y_batch) in enumerate(data_loader):
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(x_batch)
        
        # Reshape outputs and labels for loss computation
        outputs = outputs.view(-1, vocab_size)
        labels = y_batch.view(-1)
        
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        if (i+1) % 100 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Step [{i+1}/{len(data_loader)}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

### Explanation:

- **DataLoader**: Loads data in batches. Helps in shuffling and parallelizing data loading.
- **CrossEntropyLoss**: Used as the loss function for classification tasks.
- **Optimizer**: Adam is used for optimization.
- **Forward Pass**: Compute the model output and loss for each batch.
- **Backward Pass**: Compute the gradients and update the parameters.

This is a simplified example and doesn't include additional aspects like validation, model saving, or more advanced functionalities.
