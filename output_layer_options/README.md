# Output Linear Options

The output layer directly projects to `vocab_size`. This is okay for a language model but might not suit all tasks. Ensure this meets your requirements.

1. **Good for Language Models**: Projecting to `vocab_size` is ideal for language models where you want to predict the next token from a vocabulary. The output layer acts as a classifier for each token in the vocabulary.

2. **Not Always Suitable**: For tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or sequence-to-sequence translation, you might not need to project to the entire vocabulary size. You might project to a smaller output size corresponding to the number of classes, sentiments, or other task-specific dimensions.

### Alternatives:

1. **Task-Specific Projection**: If you're performing classification, you can change the output layer to project to the number of classes.
   ```python
   self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, num_classes)
   ```

2. **No Projection**: For some tasks like embedding generation or feature extraction, you might not want an output layer at all.

3. **Multiple Output Heads**: If your model is multitask, you can have multiple output layers, each tailored for a specific task.

### Code Example:

For a text classification task with three classes (Positive, Neutral, Negative), you might modify the last layer as follows:

```python
# For Text Classification with 3 classes
self.fc_out = nn.Linear(embed_size, 3)
```

For generating embeddings:

```python
# For Embedding Generation
# Remove the self.fc_out line entirely, and directly output the transformer's output
```

For a multitask model:

```python
# For Multi-Task Learning
self.fc_out1 = nn.Linear(embed_size, vocab_size)  # For language modeling
self.fc_out2 = nn.Linear(embed_size, num_classes)  # For classification
```

Choose the appropriate output layer based on your specific application and requirements.

Is it better to first train embeddings and then focus on predicting the next token?

### Training Embeddings First:

1. **Pros**:
- Faster convergence during pre-training.
- Embeddings can be fine-tuned for the specific task.

2. **Cons**:
- Two-stage training process can be cumbersome.
- May lead to suboptimal results if the embedding training data is different from the language model training data.

### Training End-to-End:

1. **Pros**:
- Single training process.
- Embeddings are optimized for the task from the start, leading to potentially better results.

2. **Cons**:
- Slower convergence.

### In Practice:

Most state-of-the-art models like GPT and BERT train embeddings as part of the overall model, in an end-to-end fashion. This approach is generally found to be effective because the embeddings are learned in the context of the specific task (e.g., language modeling), leading to better performance.

### Conclusion:

For best results, especially in complex tasks, it is generally better to train the model end-to-end to predict the next token, rather than separating the embedding training phase.
